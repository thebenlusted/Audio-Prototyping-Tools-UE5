# GameAudioTools
 This is a collection of audio tools I have created using Unreal Engine 5.2.

 The goal is to create a group of Blueprints, audio asset examples, and assets to quickly implement audio into a game. 
 These are tools I use when prototyping and thought they could be useful to others.

 Current systems:
 - Backing ambient loop manager
 - Simple ambient switch actor with reverb option
 - Drag-and-drop dynamic footstep system
 - Weather system (WIP)

 Also included is a full game audio mix setup within Unreal Engine 5, example audio waves, example MetaSound assets, a handful of generic attenuation and concurrency settings, and a testing level.

 * Feel free to use everything included in this project. All code and audio is completely free to use. *
