# Unreal Engine - Audio Prototyping Tools ðŸŽ§

 *This is a work in progress. Some tools may be unfinished or contain bugs. I am actively updating this and problems will be addressed ASAP*

This is a collection of simple tools that I have created and used on numerous game projects.
These tools may be useful for developers who want to quickly drag-and-drop audio systems into their prototypes.

Blueprints included in this bundle are highly scalable, easy to read and follow, and are made purely inside of Unreal Engine 5.2 which means no extra setup or additional plugins.

 ## Current systems ðŸ’»:
 - Backing ambient loop manager
 - One-shot "Big World Sound" player based on player position and location
 - Simple ambient switch actor with reverb option
 - Drag-and-drop dynamic footstep system
 - Ambient Music System
 - Weather system (WIP)

Also included is a full game audio mix setup within Unreal Engine 5, example audio waves, example MetaSound assets, a handful of generic attenuation and concurrency settings, and a testing level.


Feel free to use everything included in this project. All code and audio is completely free to use.
